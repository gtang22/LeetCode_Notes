## Maximum Sum Circular Subarray

Hint: Kadane's Algorithm with a twist

# Main idea:

If the array wasn't circular we know that the maximum would have to be like this:

This also means that the area we didn't chose holds the *minimum subarray* (Makes sense cause the maximum subarray comes from the **total - the sum of the minimum subarray**). As seen below:

We can do the same with a circular array:

Think about it, we have 2 possibilities:

  - The maximum array is somewhere in the middle, so we just proceed as normal.
  - The maximum array is the ends somewhere, meaning the minimum subarray is in the middle.

# Solution:

  We go through the array calculating both the maximum subarray and the minimum subarray (and the total) and at the end. We see which is greater, then sum of the middle maximum array or the total - the sum of the minimum array.

  *Note: There's a special condition if the array is all negatives, leading to the if-statement in the return line. If we don't have that, the method will return 0, but the maximum is still correct. 

``` java
class Solution {
    public int maxSubarraySumCircular(int[] nums) {
        int max = Integer.MIN_VALUE;
        int sumTemp = 0;
        int min = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
        int minTemp = 0;
        int total = 0;

        for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
            sumTemp += nums[i];
            minTemp += nums[i];
            minTemp = Math.min(minTemp, nums[i]);
            max = Math.max(sumTemp, max);
            min = Math.min(minTemp, min);
            total += nums[i];

            if (sumTemp < 0) {
                sumTemp = 0;
            }

        }

        return max > 0 ? Math.max(total - min, max) : max;
    }
}
