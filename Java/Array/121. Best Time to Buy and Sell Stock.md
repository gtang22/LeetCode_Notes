## Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock

Hint: Two Pointer

- One fast, one slow
- If value at fast pointer is lower than the one at slow, move slow to fast

``` java
class Solution {
    public int maxProfit(int[] prices) {
        int buyPrice = prices[0];
        int profit = 0;

        for(int sellDay = 1; sellDay < prices.length; sellDay++) {
            if (prices[sellDay] < buyPrice) {
                buyPrice = prices[sellDay];
            } else if (profit < prices[sellDay] - buyPrice) {
                profit = prices[sellDay] - buyPrice;
            }
        }

        return profit;
    }
}
