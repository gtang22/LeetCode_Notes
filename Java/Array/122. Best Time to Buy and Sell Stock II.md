## Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock II

Hint: Think of Slopes

-  When reaching a point, you want to get the profit when the price stops rising.
-  You want to do this at every occurance.
-  For each point, cash out when the price stops rising, if it never rises, don't buy it.

``` java

class Solution {
    public int maxProfit(int[] prices) {
        int days = 0;
        int profit = 0;

         for (int sellDay = 1; sellDay < prices.length; sellDay++) {
            if (prices[sellDay] >= prices[sellDay - 1]){
                days++;
            } else {
                profit += prices[sellDay - 1] - prices[sellDay - days - 1];
                days = 0;
            }
            //System.out.println(profit + " " + days);
        }

        if (days > 0) {
            profit += prices[prices.length - 1] - prices[prices.length - 1 - days];
        }

        return profit;

    }
}
