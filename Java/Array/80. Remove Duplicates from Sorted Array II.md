## 80. Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array II (Allows for 2 of each value)

**(Note: This problem returns the length of the array given each value can have at most 2 occruances)**

Hint: Two Pointer (Slow and Fast)

- Slow and Fast Pointers and a count var
- Fast pointer is **always** incremented
- Slow pointer is incremented with certain conditions (Many conditions)
- Conditions:
    - If the num at slow and fast isn't the same
        - If the count is greater than 2
    - If the num is the same

```java
class Solution {
    public int removeDuplicates(int[] nums) {
        int slow = 0;
        int count = 1;
        int fast = 1;

        for (; fast < nums.length; fast++) {
            if (nums[slow] != nums[fast]) {
                if (count > 1) {
                    slow++;
                    nums[slow] = nums[slow-1];
                }
                slow++;
                nums[slow] = nums[fast];
                count = 1;
            } else {
                count++;
            }
        }

        if (count > 1) {
            slow++;
            nums[slow] = nums[slow - 1];
        }

        return slow + 1;
    }
}
