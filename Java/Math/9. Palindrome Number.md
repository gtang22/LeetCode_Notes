# Palindrome Number

Hint: Use %

- If the number is negative, then it can't be a palindrome
- Rebuild the number using mod (the last digit in the number) (which builds it backwards) and check to see if it's the same as the given number

``` java 
class Solution {
    public boolean isPalindrome(int x) {
        int temp = x;
        int sum = 0;

        while (x > 0) {
            int temp2 = x % 10;
            sum = (sum*10) + temp2;
            x = x / 10;
        }

        return sum == temp;        
    }
}
