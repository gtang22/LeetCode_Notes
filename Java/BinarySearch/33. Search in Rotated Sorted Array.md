# Search in Rotated Sorted Array

Hint: Check midpoint and compare it to left/right values

- Check mid point and compare it to left/right values.
    - If the value at mid is greater than the one at the left, then you know that side is the sorted side.
      - If it's sorted, proceed with normal binary search
    - On the other hand, if it isn't, you know that part isn't the sorted side
      - move right and left as you need to

``` java

class Solution {
    public int search(int[] nums, int target) {
        // One solution: sort then use binary search
        // step one: find the beginning of the array
        // step two: determine which half our value could be in
        // step three: binary search that half
        int left = 0;
        int right = nums.length - 1;
        int mid = 0;

        while (left <= right) {
            mid = left + (right - left)/2;
            if (nums[mid] == target) {
                return mid;
            }
            if (nums[mid] >= nums[left]) {
                if (nums[left] <= target && target < nums[mid]) {
                    right = mid - 1;
                } else {
                    left = mid + 1;
                }
            } else {
                if (nums[mid] < target && target <= nums[right]) {
                    left = mid + 1;
                } else {
                    right = mid - 1;
                }
            }
        }

        return -1;
    }
}
