# Find Minimum in Rotated Sorted Array

Hint: What does the value at the middle tell you when compared to the edges?

- Ordinary BS but with certain conditions
- Conditions:
    - Obvious one: If left and right point to the same place?
    - If the value at the middle is greater than the value on the right?
        - This means that the smallest value is between those two (Think about it)
    - Else, what do you do?
    - Pratice with the example array given below, also use it to figure out where to + 1, - 1, or whatever

``` java
class Solution {
    public int findMin(int[] nums) {
        int left = 0;
        int right = nums.length - 1;
        int min = 0;
        
        while (left <= right) {
            int mid = left + (right - left) / 2;
            if (left == right) {
                min = nums[right];
                break;
            } else if (nums[mid] > nums[right]) {
                left = mid + 1;
            } else {
                right = mid;
            }
        }

        return min;
    }
}
