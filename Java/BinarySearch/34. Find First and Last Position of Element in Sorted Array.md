# Find First and Last Position of Element in Sorted Array

Hint: Do multiple binary searches (the devil's in the details)

- When searching for the left most var:
  - if the middle has the same value (Only different condition from normal binary search).
      - That means there's a chance of finding the same num on the left side, so move the right to the number on the left of mid.
      - Make sure to keep track of every occurance of finding the var.

- Do a similar thing to the right most var:


## Special Conditions

- Remember to think about the edge cases of the list having a length of 0 or 1.

- Another edge case is if the number doesn't exist in the list


``` java 
class Solution {
    public int[] searchRange(int[] nums, int target) {
        if (nums.length == 0) {
            return new int[]{-1, -1};
        }
        // seperately find the first and last occurances
        int left = 0;
        int right = nums.length - 1;
        int mid = 0;
        int leftMostIndex = -1;
        int rightMostIndex = -1;

        // find left most occurance
        while (left <= right) {
            mid = left + (right - left) / 2;

            if (nums[mid] < target) {
                left = mid + 1;
            } else if (nums[mid] > target) {
                right = mid - 1;
            } else {
                leftMostIndex = mid;
                right = mid - 1;
            }

        }
        leftMostIndex = leftMostIndex == -1 ? -1 : left;

        left = 0;
        right = nums.length - 1;
        mid = 0;

        // find right most occurance
        while (left <= right) {
            mid = left + (right - left) / 2;

            if (nums[mid] < target) {
                left = mid + 1;
            } else if (nums[mid] > target) {
                right = mid - 1;
            } else {
                rightMostIndex = mid;
                left = mid + 1;
            }

        }

        rightMostIndex = rightMostIndex == -1 ? -1 : right;

        return new int[]{leftMostIndex, rightMostIndex};
    }
}
