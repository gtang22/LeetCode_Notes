Hint: Nah bro, you got this.

# Finding Middle Index Value
The obvious way would be to add the left and right index together and divide by 2, however, this can run into an integer overload error (AKA the number is too big). Therefore, we can use:

    mid = left + (right - left)/2 

This guarantees that the mid value will be within the bounds for a integer. 

The formula also generally makes sense, you're adding the distance from the mid point to left.


``` java
class Solution {
    public int searchInsert(int[] nums, int target) {
        int right = nums.length - 1;
        int left = 0;
        int mid = 0;

        while (left <= right) {
            mid = left + (right - left)/2;

            if (target < nums[mid]) {
                right = mid - 1;
            } else if (target > nums[mid]) {
                left = mid + 1;
            } else {
                return mid;
            }
        }

        return left;
    }
}
