# Linked List Cycle

Hint: Fast and slow pointers

- If fast goes by two, eventually it'll catch up to the slow pointer, meaning there is a cycle in the list
- (ArrayList solution) Add the node into an arraylist and return false if the node already exists in the list.
  - Works but is really slow and takes up a lot of space


``` java 
/**
 * Definition for singly-linked list.
 * class ListNode {
 *     int val;
 *     ListNode next;
 *     ListNode(int x) {
 *         val = x;
 *         next = null;
 *     }
 * }
 */
public class Solution {
    public boolean hasCycle(ListNode head) {
        // ArrayList Way (Slow and memory is bad)
        // Better way: Two pointer (fast and slow solution)
        if (head != null) {
            ListNode fast = head;
            ListNode slow = head;

            while (fast.next != null && fast.next.next != null) {
                fast = fast.next.next;
                slow = slow.next;  
                if (fast == slow) {
                    return true;
                } 
            }
            return false;
        }
        return false;
    }
}
