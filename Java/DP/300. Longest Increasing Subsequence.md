# Longest Increasing Subsequence

Hint: (Other than it being a 1D DP question, nothing much)

# Stack "Solution"

- Could think of using a stack, it works for certain examples. Ex. test with [1, 2, 3, 7, 4, 10, 9]
- But it won't work with other examples. Ex. [0, 1, 0, 3, 2, 3]
  - 0 and 1 would be needed to get the max sequence length of 4, but the 0 and 3 right after will remove them, giving you the answer of 2 instead.

# Real Solution

- Make an array with the same length of the given one. This will be used to keep track of the maximum sequence for each number at that point. (It's our cache array)
- The base case is the firts element, it has a value of 1
- First for loop:
  - For each index in the array, go through every index behind it (second for loop)
    - If the our current number has a higher value than the one in our second for loop, get its max sequence and add one
    - Keep track of the actual maximum sequence (Use Math.max() every time)
  - Put the maximum sequence for that value in our cache array
