# Climbing Stairs

Hint: Fibonnaci sequence

- Create a array that is the the length of the given number + 2 (the + 2 is for dealing when given n = 0 or 1, but can be treated as special cases)
- Set the base cases (0, 1, 2)
- Basically Fibonnaci 

``` java
class Solution {
    public int climbStairs(int n) {
        int[] stairs = new int[n + 2];

        stairs[0] = 0;
        stairs[1] = 1;
        stairs[2] = 2;

        // for each stair, keep track of how many times you can climb up 
        for (int i = 3; i < stairs.length; i++) {
            stairs[i] = stairs[i - 1] + stairs[i - 2]; 
        }

        return stairs[n];
    }
}
