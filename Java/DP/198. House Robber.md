# House Robber

Hint: 1D Array 

## My Solution:

- Went though every house
- Went through every house (that came before and wasn't adjacent to the current house)
- Got the maximum possible money from those houses
- Set that house's index in the new list as that maximum

``` java
class Solution {
    public int rob(int[] nums) {
        if (nums.length == 1) {
            return nums[0];
        }

        int[] moneyRobbed = new int[nums.length];

        // get the maximum number of money from robbing houses before it (not including adjacent houses)
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
            int tempMax = nums[i];
            for (int j = 0; j < i - 1; j++) {
                tempMax = Math.max(tempMax, nums[i] + moneyRobbed[j]);
            }
            moneyRobbed[i] = tempMax;
        }

        return Math.max(moneyRobbed[moneyRobbed.length - 1], moneyRobbed[moneyRobbed.length - 2]);
    }
}
```

## Optimal Solution:

- The only difference is that we don't have to check EVERY house, just the one adjacent and the one before that (they should also have their maximum possible amount)
- The idea is that each house has the greatest possible sum of their subsection
- So the current house has two options:
      - Add their sum to the nonadjacent sum
      - Or be skipped and take the adjacent house's sum instead
- Do whatever gets you the most money

``` java
class Solution {
    public int rob(int[] nums) {
        if (nums.length == 1) {
            return nums[0];
        }

        int[] moneyRobbed = new int[nums.length];
        moneyRobbed[0] = nums[0];
        moneyRobbed[1] = Math.max(nums[0], nums[1]);

        // get the maximum number of money from robbing houses before it (not including adjacent houses)
        for (int i = 2; i < nums.length; i++) {
            moneyRobbed[i] = Math.max(moneyRobbed[i-2] + nums[i], moneyRobbed[i-1]);
        }

        return moneyRobbed[moneyRobbed.length - 1];
    }
}
```
