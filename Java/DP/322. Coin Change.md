# Coin Change

Hint: 1D Array (Also don't assume there's a coin with the value of 1)

- Get an array that has the size of amount + 1 (The + 1 is so we can have the value itself as an index)
- Fill with -1 (The values that can't be made will remain as -1 at the end)
- Have value at index 0 be 0
- For every amount:
  - For every coin:
      - If the value is the exact value of the coin, have it set to 1
      - Else, check to see if the value minus the current coin's value is possible:
          - If it is, then add one to that count and see if it's the smallest number we have (not counting -1)
- Return if the final value is possible or not

``` java
class Solution {
    public int coinChange(int[] coins, int amount) {
        int[] amounts = new int[amount + 1];
        // fill the entire array with -1
        // values that can't be made will remain as -1 at the end
        Arrays.fill(amounts, -1);
        // 0 is always 0
        amounts[0] = 0;

        for (int i = 1; i < amounts.length; i++) {
            // for every coin
            for (int j = 0; j < coins.length; j++) {
                int coinVal = coins[j];
                // if the amount is the coin value, have it set as 1
                if (i == coinVal) {
                    amounts[i] = 1;
                    break;
                // if the sum is able to be made (checked by seeing if a sum - the coin value can be made)
                } else if (i > coinVal && amounts[i - coinVal] > -1) {
                    // If the sum is able to made with the coin, set it as so 
                    // so we an use Math.min without getting -1 as an answer
                    if (amounts[i] == -1) {
                        amounts[i] = amounts[i - coinVal] + 1;
                    }
                    // get the smallest possible number of coins
                    amounts[i] = Math.min(amounts[i - coinVal] + 1, amounts[i]);
                }
            }
        }

        //System.out.println(Arrays.toString(amounts));

        return amounts[amounts.length - 1];
    }
}
