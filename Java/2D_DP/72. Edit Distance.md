# Edit Distance

Hint: The matrix should be dimensions [word1.length() + 1][word2.length() + 1] and think about how to do it with pointers


# Understanding the Intuition

Base Cases: If one or both of the strings are empty. If they're both empty, then 0 should be returned. If one if empty, then what should be returned in the number of characters if the non-empty one (Cause all we'd need to do is just add all the characters, right?)

- Understanding the operations:
  - Insert: If a character was inserted, then the first pointer should move forward.
  - Replace: Then both pointers should move forward.
  - Delete: If a character was deleted, then the second pointer should move forward.
  - Move: If both characters are the same, then both pointers should move forward.

- After filling out the base cases all around the matrix (like above), we can start with our bottom up code
- If we insert a character, we'd have to check [i][j + 1] + 1 (for our move of insertion)
- If we replace a character, we'd have to check [i + 1][j + 1] + 1 (for our move of replacement)
- If we delete a character, we'd have to check [i + 1][j + 1] + 1 (for our move of deletion)
- If we don't have to do any of that, we can just keep the value at [i + 1][j + 1] but with no + 1, because there isn't any replacement
- However, which move do we do? We do the one with least moves, so we have to use Math.min() to check for it
- Do this until you reach the beginning of each string [0][0], and return the value there.

``` java 
class Solution {
    public int minDistance(String word1, String word2) {
        if (word1.length() == 0 || word2.length() == 0) {
            return word1.length() == 0 ? word2.length() : word1.length();
        }
        // base case: If one string is empty, then the number of opertations would the length
        // of the non-empty string
        // another, base case: If strings are both empty, then return 0
        int[][] matrix = new int[word1.length() + 1][word2.length() + 1];

        for (int i = 0; i < word1.length() + 1; i++) {
            matrix[i][word2.length()] = word1.length() - i;
        }

        for (int i = 0; i < word2.length() + 1; i++) {
            matrix[word1.length()][i] = word2.length() - i;
        }

        
        for (int i = word1.length() - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
            for (int j = word2.length() - 1; j >= 0; j--) {
                // within the boundary to see if you should insert, replace, or delete
                if (word1.charAt(i) == word2.charAt(j)) {
                    matrix[i][j] = matrix[i + 1][j + 1];
                } else {
                    int insert = matrix[i + 1][j];
                    int replace = matrix[i + 1][j + 1];
                    int delete = matrix[i][j + 1];

                    matrix[i][j] = Math.min(insert, Math.min(replace, delete)) + 1;
                }
            }
        }


        return matrix[0][0];
    }
}
