# Minimum Path Sum

Hint: Bottom-top, 2D DP

## Problem

Find the minimum path from the top left corner to the bottom right corner. The robot can only move down or right (helps A LOT)

## Solution

- Make a matrix to keep track of the distances (same size as given array)
- Set the base case at the end to be its own distance (the math works better this way)
- Then for each index (starting from behind)
    - Check the tile below them and the tile to the right of them  (if they exist)
    - Then get the shortest path from the two and them
    - Then assign the shortest path plus the distance at that index to the index in our new array
- Return the value at [0][0] in our array

``` java
class Solution {
    public int minPathSum(int[][] grid) {
        int[][] minimumPaths = new int[grid.length][grid[0].length];
        int[][] directions = {{0, 1}, {1, 0}};

        // minimum distance to end from end is 0
        minimumPaths[grid.length - 1][grid[0].length - 1] = grid[grid.length - 1][grid[0].length - 1];
        // subproblem: finding the smallest distance for every square
        for (int i = grid.length - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
            for (int j = grid[0].length - 1; j >= 0; j--) {
                // if the tile isn't the end one 
                if (i != grid.length - 1 || j != grid[0].length - 1) {
                    // check all surrounding paths and get the shortest path
                    // only need to check the files under and tile to the right of current tile
                    int smallestValue = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
                    for (int k = 0; k < directions.length; k++) {
                        int row = i + directions[k][0];
                        int col = j + directions[k][1];

                        if (row >= 0 && row <= grid.length - 1 && col >= 0 && col <= grid[0].length - 1) {
                            smallestValue = Math.min(smallestValue, minimumPaths[row][col]);
                        }
                    }
                    minimumPaths[i][j] = grid[i][j] + smallestValue;

                }
            }
        }

        return minimumPaths[0][0];
    }
}
