# Unique Paths II

Hint: Base case (Focus on the math, not the logic for it (Trust, it'll work out))

## Problem

Get the number of unique paths from the top left corner to the bottom right corner. There are also obstacles that you have to avoid.

## Solution

- Make a new matrix that has the same size as the given one
- Set the base case in our new array to 1(the value is less logical, but works out)
- For every index (We start from the end for both loops)
    - If the tile is an obstacle, then put in a 0
    - If the tile below and tile to the right aren't out of bounds, check for how many paths they have
    - Add the total paths and set them to the index in our new matrix
- Return the value at [0][0] in our matrix


``` java
class Solution {
    public int uniquePathsWithObstacles(int[][] obstacleGrid) {
        int[][] pathGrid = new int[obstacleGrid.length][obstacleGrid[0].length];

        // only cna move down/right
        // base case (Why is it 1? and not 2?)
        pathGrid[obstacleGrid.length - 1][obstacleGrid[0].length - 1] = 1;

        for (int i = obstacleGrid.length - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
            for (int j = obstacleGrid[0].length - 1; j >= 0; j--) {
                // add the values (that aren't out of bounds) from the bottom and the right to get the number of paths
                // if there's an obstacle, just put 0
                if (obstacleGrid[i][j] == 1) {
                    pathGrid[i][j] = 0;
                } else {
                    if (i + 1 < obstacleGrid.length) {
                        pathGrid[i][j] += pathGrid[i + 1][j];
                    }
                    if (j + 1 < obstacleGrid[0].length) {
                        pathGrid[i][j] += pathGrid[i][j + 1];
                    }
                }
            }
        }


        return pathGrid[0][0];
    }
}
