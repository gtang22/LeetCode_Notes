# Interleaving String (More Like Interwoven String)

## Problem Description:

Given 3 strings, the third one should be made by interweaving the other two strings:

## Solution

Hint: Make a 2D array of s1.length() + 1 and s2.length() + 1 (Will be explained later)* and fill bottom - up

- First, if the length of the 3rd doesn't match the combined length of the other two strings, you can return false immediately.
- Now we can cache with a 2D matrix, we'll call it stringCache
- As previously stated, it'll have the dimensions of s1.length() + 1 and s2.length() + 1, this is because of how we're using the indexes as pointers.
- The base case is at stringCache[s1.length() + 1][s2.length() + 1] and it'll be True
  - *What does this mean? The indexes of the matrix can be used as pointers, so that index means that we've reached the end of both strings, meaning the third string is made from every character in both strings
- Now the for loop:
  - For every index in the matrix, first, we get the position of where we'd be in the third string given our indexes (sum of the row and column)
  - Check if our index is in bound and if the character matches from either string 1 or string 2 (Make sure to have this as 2 different if- statements)
  - (Tricky part) We then check if the index under it or to the right of it is true
      - This means that the third string still has letters that can come from either string 1 or string 2
  - If all those conditions match, set it to true
- Return the value at [0][0]

``` java
class Solution {
    public boolean isInterleave(String s1, String s2, String s3) {
        if (s1.length() + s2.length() != s3.length()) {
            return false;
        }

        // can use caching with a matrix

        boolean[][] stringCache = new boolean[s1.length() + 1][s2.length() + 1];

        stringCache[s1.length()][s2.length()] = true;

        for(int i = s1.length(); i >= 0; i--) {
            for(int j = s2.length(); j >= 0; j--) {
                int stringIndex = i + j;
                // if in bounds and the character matches
                // 2 possibilities, the character is in the first or second string
                // but also, the next path has to be true (either down or to the right)
                if (i < s1.length() && s3.charAt(stringIndex) == s1.charAt(i) && stringCache[i + 1][j]) {
                    stringCache[i][j] = true;
                }
                if (j < s2.length() && s3.charAt(stringIndex) == s2.charAt(j) && stringCache[i][j + 1]) {
                    stringCache[i][j] = true;
                }
            }
        }

        return stringCache[0][0];

    }
}
