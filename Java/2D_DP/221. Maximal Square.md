Hint: Only need to check the right, bottom, and diagonal

## Solution

- Base case: the corner/right and bottom sides (They'll be set to their value of 0 or 1 respectively)
- With each spot, you only need to check the right, bottom, and diagonal (do it recursively to check)
- Get the minimum and add one to it and set it (This is the longest length of the square that could start at this index)
- Keep track of the largest length
- Return the length squared.

``` java
class Solution {
    public int maximalSquare(char[][] matrix) {
        int[][] largestSquare = new int[matrix.length][matrix[0].length];
        int max = 0;

        largestSquare[matrix.length - 1][matrix[0].length - 1] = matrix[matrix.length - 1][matrix[0].length - 1] - '0';

        
        for (int i = matrix.length - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
            for (int j = matrix[0].length - 1; j >= 0; j--) {
                // get the largest square you could make
                if (matrix[i][j] == '0') {
                    largestSquare[i][j] = 0;
                } else {
                    int smallestSize = 1;
                    // check the one to the right, below, and diagonal and get the smallest one (that isn't 0)
                    if (i < matrix.length - 1 && j < matrix[0].length -1) {
                        // if not an edge, meaning the right, below, and diagonal exist
                        int rightSize = largestSquare[i][j + 1];
                        int belowSize = largestSquare[i + 1][j];
                        int diagonalSize = largestSquare[i + 1][j + 1];

                        smallestSize = Math.min(rightSize, Math.min(belowSize, diagonalSize)) + 1;
                    }

                    largestSquare[i][j] = smallestSize;
                    max = Math.max(smallestSize, max);
                }
            }


        }


        return max * max;

    }
}
