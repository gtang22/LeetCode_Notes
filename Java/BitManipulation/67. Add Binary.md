# Add Binary

Hint: There's a way to do it without bit manipulation, but hint for bit manipluation (BigInteger)

## Solution without Bit Manipulation


- Use Stringbuilder (Can also use array)
- Have a pointer for the position in each String
- Also have a carryOver var to keep track of carry over
- Iterate over every character in each string (If it exists)
- Get the int value of the character at that position (char - '0' works for digits). If there's character (ie, we reach the end of one string, but not of the other), have it as 0.
- Add them together and % by 2 to get the number at that position
- Get the carryOver from dividing our calculated sum by 2
- Keep going until every character from both strings have been seen and the carryOver var is 0


``` java
class Solution {
    public String addBinary(String a, String b) {
        // Make Stringbuilder
        StringBuilder ans = new StringBuilder();
        int carryOver = 0;
        int indexA = a.length() - 1;
        int indexB = b.length() - 1;

        while (indexA >= 0 || indexB >= 0 || carryOver > 0) {
            int tempA = 0;
            int tempB = 0;

            if (indexA >= 0) {
                tempA = a.charAt(indexA) - '0';
                indexA--;
            }
            if (indexB >= 0) {
                tempB = b.charAt(indexB) - '0';
                indexB--;
            }
            int total = tempA + tempB + carryOver;
            ans.append(total%2);
            carryOver = total/2;
        }


        ans = ans.reverse();
        return ans.toString();  
    }
}

```
# Bit Manipluation Way (Takes longer and uses more space)

- Turn the strings into BigIntegers
- Add them together (With special method)
- Then turn it back into a binary string (With toString())
- Return that string

``` java
import java.math.BigInteger;
class Solution {
    public String addBinary(String a, String b) {
        BigInteger x = new BigInteger(a, 2);
        BigInteger y = new BigInteger(b, 2);
        BigInteger sum = x.add(y);
        String result = sum.toString(2);
        return result;
    }
}
