# Number of 1 Bits

Hint: What does the problem mean? How can we use what we know about binary (invloves powers of 2) to our advantage?

- We can calculate the Hamming weight
- First, recognize the pattern between the numbers with a Hamming weight of 1 (2, 4, 8, 16, etc..) and their binary counterparts (10, 100, 1000, 10000, etc...)
- Next, do with with other numbers like 11, 1011, how can we get 3?
  - The String answer would be to cut off the ending character every time and check to see if it's a 1, but how can we do that mathmatically?
  - 1011 -> 101, that's 11 -> 5, that's just dividing the number by 2, so how we know how to shift our number one "character" to the left
  - Okay, but how do we check that it's a one at the end?
  - Well, an easy to check is if it's odd, right? So, we can just use %2 to check if it's odd.
- We do this until the number is 0, then we return the count of 1s.
  

``` java
class Solution {
    public int hammingWeight(int n) {
        // turn n into binary string and then count
        // Bit manipluation (<<)
        // count how many times it needs to be divided by 2

        int count = 0;

        while (n > 0) {
            if (n % 2 == 1) {
                count++;
            }
            n /= 2;
        }

        return count;
    }
}
