# Kth Smallest Element in a BST

Hint: Inorder and an array to keep count

- Write a method to get the tree's values inorder and return an array.
- There will be an array with only one value (it'll be value of k to keep track of which element you're on)
- **IMPORTANT**: Has to be an array, because the value will carry over, it won't if it's just a normal int.
- For every value, decrease k[0] by 1, and keep going until either:
  - The kth element is reached.
  - The root is null.
  - You've reached the end of the tree.
