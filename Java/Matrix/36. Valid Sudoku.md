## Valid Sudoku

Hint: Use a HashSet of Strings and record the presense of the value with a String

- Iterate through every element in the sudoku board.
- if there's a value, then you should check the following conditions:
    - There isn't the same element in the same row.
    - There isn't the same element in the same column.
    - There isn't the same element in the same sudoku block.
 - How can we tell those things? **KEEP TRACK OF THEM THROUGH STRINGS**
     - The format:
       - rowNum + (elementValue)
       - (elementValue) + colNum
       - blockX + (elementValue) + blockY

# How the block works:

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/75ea66ce-6f46-4341-81ba-c97b9dd8285e)
       X : [0, 1, 2]
       Y : [0, 1, 2]

Example: for 5, it's in block 0, 0, because 0/0 = 0 and 0/0 = 0, for 6, it's in block 1, 1, because 5/3 = 1 and 4/3 = 1

       

``` java
class Solution {
    public boolean isValidSudoku(char[][] board) {
        Set<String> seen = new HashSet<>();

        for (int r = 0; r < 9; r++) {
            for (int c = 0; c < 9; c++) {
                if (board[r][c] != '.') {
                    // format of strings Col + (Value), (Value) + Row, Col/3 + (Value) + Row/3
                    // 3 qualifications 
                    // can't be in same row
                    // can't be in same col
                    // can't be in same block
                    String temp = "(" + board[r][c] + ")";
                    // the add method in set is a boolean (returns false if not added bc already in set)
                    if (!seen.add(c + temp) || !seen.add(temp + r) || ! seen.add((c/3) + temp + (r/3))) {
                        return false;
                    }
                }
            }
        }

        return true; 
    }
}
