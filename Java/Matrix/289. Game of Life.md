# Game of Life

Hint: Have different values to represent different states (specfically transitions)

- Use arrays to keep track of neighbors.
- Have a cell that will transition from alive to dead be 2.
- Have a cell that will transition from dead to alive be 3.
- When checking for if a neighbor is alive, check if the value is 1 or 2.
- At the end, go over the entire matrix and change the values (2,3) to 0 or 1.
